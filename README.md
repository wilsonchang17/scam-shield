# Scam Shield: Multi-Model Scam Detection

**Scam Shield** is an AI-driven scam detection tool designed to identify both obvious and adversarial scam messages. It implements the research methodology presented in the paper **"Scam Shield: Multi-Model Voting and Fine-Tuned LLMs Against Adversarial Attacks" (ECML PKDD 2025)**.

## Key Features
- **Real-time scam detection**
- **Multi-model voting** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, KNN)
- **Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 8B** (LoRA optimized)
- Includes scam examples for reference

---

## Background
This tool is based on advanced research aimed at detecting sophisticated scams, including adversarial attacks crafted to evade detection by traditional methods.

The core of the system is a hierarchical approach:
- **Step 1:** Majority voting by traditional ML classifiers.
- **Step 2:** Fine-tuned LLM (LLaMA 8B) provides final verification and resolves uncertain cases.
